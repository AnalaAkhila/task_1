      Venkatesh Prabhu adopted the screen name "Dhanush" after being inspired by the
      fictional covert operation from Kuruthipunal (1995).[29] He debuted in the 2002
      teen drama film Thulluvadho Ilamai, directed by his father Kasthuri Raja, which
      became a sleeper hit. He then appeared in his brother Selvaraghavan's first directorial 
      venture, the romantic psychological thriller Kaadhal Kondein in 2003. The film portrayed
      Dhanush as a mentally-disturbed youth, Vinodh, who yearned for the love of his friend, eventually 
    turning possessive of her. Upon release, the film opened to critical acclaim and proved to be a major
    commercial success, eventually becoming Dhanush's breakthrough in Tamil cinema.[30] The film also
     fetched him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor â€“ Tamil. His next film was the
     romantic comedy Thiruda Thirudi (2003), a critical and commercial success.
